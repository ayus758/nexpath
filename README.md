## The Problem

Students preparing for competitive exams or corporate interviews face one massive, overlooked problem — **everything is scattered**.

To prepare for GATE, a student visits YouTube for lectures, a coaching website for syllabus, Telegram for notes, forums for PYQs, and blogs for strategy. For a Google interview, the same chaos — LeetCode for practice, Glassdoor for experiences, GeeksforGeeks for theory, and Reddit for roadmaps.

**There is no single platform that brings all of this together and makes it intelligent.**

---

## Our Solution

**NexPath** is a centralized education and career intelligence platform that:

- Aggregates scattered resources from across the web using NLP
- Generates **AI-powered personalized roadmaps** for any exam or career goal
- Analyzes **skill gaps** against real exam syllabi and company requirements
- Reviews **resumes** using AI and returns structured improvement feedback
- Surfaces **trending tech stacks** and in-demand skills by industry
- Hosts a **community knowledge base** of real interview and exam experiences

> One platform. Every resource. Fully personalized.

OpenAI / Gemini API  (resume analysis · skill gap · roadmap generation)        
```

**Architecture:** MERN-based modular MVC. React frontend communicates with Node.js/Express REST APIs. AI APIs handle resume analysis, skill gap detection, and career roadmap generation. MongoDB stores user profiles, resources, interview experiences, and community data. JWT secures all API endpoints.
